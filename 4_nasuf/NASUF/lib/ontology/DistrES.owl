    >"A collection of spatially-localized individuals, including various actions and events as well as physical objects. Each instance of InformationBearingThing (or "IBT") is an item that contains information (for an agent who knows how to interpret it). Examples: a copy of the novel Moby Dick; a signal buoy; a photograph; an elevator sign in Braille; a map; a US dollar bill; a resume; a musical score; copies of the CycProgram. 
For representations of the propositional content of information bearing things, see PropositionalInformationThing; but note that not all IBTs have a propositional content (cf. ArtObject). An important specialization of InformationBearingThing is InformationBearingObject, which comprises all of those IBTs that are also physical objects (i.e. PartiallyTangibles). Though often a subtle task in particular contexts, it is important to distinguish the various specializations of InformationBearingThing from those of AspatialInformationStore (whose instances are the chunks of information instantiated in particular IBTs; see instantiationOfAIT) and from those of ConceptualWork (whose instances are the conceptual or artistic creations that are instantiated in particular IBTs; see instantiationOfWork). 

For instance, TextString is a specialization of AspatialInformationStore, TextualMaterial is a specialization of InformationBearingThing, and TextualPCW is a specialization of ConceptualWork; to conflate any of these with another would be to make a "category error". Also note that events in which information is transferred (see InformationTransferEvent) are not considered instances of InformationBearingThing. Rather, such transfer events have as one of their participants (see actors) some instance of InformationBearingThing; though in cases where IBTs are themselves events this will require distinguishing very finely between the event that encodes the information and the event that is the information transfer. See also the sense-modality-based specializations, SoundInformationBearingThing and VisualInformationBearingThing." </rdfs:comment>

    >"A specialization of PurposefulAction and characterized by one or more InformationTransferEvent sub-events. Each instance of Communicating is an event in which the transfer of information between or among agents is a focal action; communicating is the main purpose and/or goal in the event. That may be contrasted with events which involve communication but wherein the focus is different, e.g., playing cards (wherein the progressive actions -- and winning -- of the game are focal). Since Communicating is a specialization of PurposefulAction, each Communicating event must be intentional on the part of the #$communicatorOfInfo; it may or may not be intentional on the part of the agent playing the #$infoCommunicatedTo role. Hence, a speaker on a soapbox haranguing an indifferent crowd is performing an instance of Communicating. In contrast, Juliet soliloquizing on her balcony, unaware that Romeo is listening to her, is not Communicating; rather Romeo (and Juliet, unaware) are engaged in an Eavesdropping. Communicating may be either a one-way or a two-way transfer of information (cf. CommunicationAct-Single, MultiDirectionalCommunication). Every event belonging to Communicating contains at least one transfer of information between at least two agents who participate in the event. (Note that the latter requirement excludes reading and writing from Communicating, when those events are just the private accessing or generating of information.) Communicating may be specialized in various ways, such as, by the method or medium used (e.g., AudioCommunicating, NonVerbalCommunicating, FaceToFacePresenceCommunicating); by the type of information involved (e.g., MakingAnAgreement); by the purpose of the communication (e.g., Teaching, Negotiating); by the agents involved (e.g., IntraOrganizationCommunication, StageProduction). Examples of Communicating include a symphony performance, an email message, a telephone call, a speech, a handshake, issuing a traffic ticket -- all of which normally, and focally, involve communication between two or more agents." </rdfs:comment>

    >"A specialization of AbstractStructure. Each instance of AbstractInformationStructure is an abstract individual comprising abstract symbols and relations between them. Important specializations of this collection include CharacterString and Sentence. AbstractInformationStructure also includes abstract diagrams, graphs, and bit strings. The collection can be more precisely defined as follows: Each AbstractInformationStructure is such that each of its physical instantiations (see #$instantiationOfAIS) consists of instantiations of instances of AtomicSymbol-Abstract, arranged in a certain way. For example, the abstract sentence 'The pig flies' is an AbstractInformationStructure. Each written instantiation of it consists of an instantiation of the words (symbols) 'The', 'pig' and 'flies', written in that order. (If the AbstractInformationStructure 'The pig flies' were spoken, the same words would appear in the same order, i.e. 'The' first, etc., but the sequence would be determined by the arrangement of the spoken words in time, rather than space.) Likewise with abstract diagrams, graphs, etc. Each of these is such that its physical instantiations consist of arrangements of instantiations of instances of AtomicSymbol-Abstract. A hard copy of a wiring diagram consists of a group of concrete symbols representing various circuit components, in which these symbols are spatially arranged in a certain in way. The arrangement of the concrete symbols in an instantiation of an AbstractInformationStructure is not always a simple matter of arrangement in space or time. The sequence of symbols '0010010111011001' can be instantiated in written, spoken, or electronic forms. In the last case, the order of the symbols is determined by conventions concerning the electronic medium in which it is stored, rather than by any common criterion for precedence or subsequence in space or time." </rdfs:comment>

Each instance of PortableObject is a tangible object that is not "fastened down" and is light enough for an average human (or, more to the point, for its average intended user) to move easily. For many instances of PortableObject, portability is important for the fulfillment of their primary functions; for example, an article of clothing (an instance of SomethingToWear), a hand-guided tool (an instance of HandTool), a coin or dollar bill (an instance of Currency), or a flashlight (an instance of Flashlight) would be pretty useless if they weren't portable. In other cases, making a device portable, or making a portable version of a device, simply provides a convenience, as with the subcollections PortableTelevision and PortableStereoSystem. Note that Tool is not a subcollection of PortableObject, since many tools are heavy and/or stationary. A borderline example of a PortableObject would be a heart/lung machine; although the beneficiary of its primary function is in no position to move it around, the physicians and nurses who also are "using" it can and do exactly that. The same goes for a playpen; the kids in it had better _not_ be able to move it around, but the adults who set it up and put them there can and do move it. A borderline non-example would be a car; even though its user can make it move around, that is more a controlling action than a transporting action --- i.e., the car is doing the transporting in that case, not the driver. A borderline example is a cat; even though it moves under its own power, it is light enough for its owner to pick it up and move it around. A borderline example is a bed or a dresser; though too heavy to lift, its owners can generally move it around (by sliding, disassembling and reassembling, and so on)." </rdfs:comment>

Each instance of SelfPoweredDevice has, as one of its internal parts, a device which converts some kind of potential energy into force. For example, a cordless electric drill would be an instance of SelfPoweredDevice, since it contains a battery and motor that convert electricity stored in the battery into kinetic energy. Other examples of SelfPoweredDevices are the instances of Automobile, which (typically) convert gasoline and battery power to get the energy to move. Of course, some muscle power is involved in operating both a cordless drill and an automobile, but in neither case is it the main part of the power. Negative exemplars of a SelfPoweredDevice include all instances of Bicycle (powered by the people who ride them), cable cars (since they are pulled along by cables embedded in the street) and subway trains (often powered by an electrified `third rail')." </rdfs:comment>

Instances of this collection are distinct from computer code and from both running and installed programs.
